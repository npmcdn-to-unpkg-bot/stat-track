# stat-track


## Notes:

### June 8, 2016
Marco - Added the ```docker``` directory. This will not be the production mongodb, but it is a skeleton of what it will eventually become. It does not work yet.

### June 9, 2016
Marco - Finished the flask-mongodb-docker template. This will serve as the seed for a more complex app. Now that I've got a basic flask app talking with a new mongodb 3.0.1 db, I can start building on this. Some things to work on are an nginx proxy system and maybe some ambassador containers.
#### To do
- Twitter scraping script  
  This will feed into the Mongodb

- Data cleaning script  
  This will transform the raw data into a usable form

- Aggregation script  
  This will aggregate the data in whichever way we see fit

- Front end interface  
  *elaborate on this*

- D3js viz  
  *elaborate on this*
